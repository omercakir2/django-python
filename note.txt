#INSERTING DATA

first of all we need to be in a python shell
# python3 manage.py shell

we need to access the class which we store our data

# from members.models import Member
here the members represents our app 
we finally get access the Member Class that is in the models.py in  this case

# member = Member(firstname='Emil', lastname='Refsnes')
# member.save()
by doing following commands we added the data to the database

# Member.objects.all().values()
for having a look at all

# UPDATING DATA

# from members.models import Member

# x = Member.objects.all()[index] 
index here represents the order of it (0,1,2,3....)
# x.firstname = "name you want to replace "
# x.save()

# DELETING DATA

# from members.models import Member

# y = Member.objects.all()[index] 
# y.delete()

# UPDATING MODEL

to add new column , you have to go the models.py which is in your app and add them

from django.db import models

my_web_site/members/models.py:

from django.db import models

class Member(models.Model):
  firstname = models.CharField(max_length=255)
  lastname = models.CharField(max_length=255)
  phone = models.IntegerField(null=True)
  joined_date = models.DateField(null=True)
  ...
  ...
# python3 manage.py makemigrations members
# python3 manage.py migrate
and you have to get migrations done so that django can udnerstand that there is new models added
